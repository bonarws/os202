TOP 10 List on Week 06!

1. [Memory Management](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/memory-management)<br>
In the OS, memory management involves the allocation (and constant reallocation) of specific memory blocks to individual programs as user demands change.<br>
2. [Virtual Memory in OS: What is, Demand Paging, Advantages](https://www.guru99.com/virtual-memory-in-operating-system.html)<br>
Virtual Memory is a storage mechanism which offers user an illusion of having a very big main memory. It is done by treating a part of secondary memory as the main memory.<br>
3. [Difference between Buffering and Caching in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-buffering-and-caching-in-os/)<br>
Both the term buffering and caching is related to storage and then access of data, but there are some key difference that makes them different. First letâ€™s see what both these term means and after that we will see the differences.<br>
4. [Contiguous and Non-Contiguous memory allocation in Operating System](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/contiguous-and-non-contiguous-memory-allocation.aspx)<br>
Memory is central to the operation of a computer system. It consists of a large array of words or bytes each with its own address.<br>
5. [How Random Access Memory (RAM) affects performance](https://www.dell.com/support/article/en-id/sln179266/how-random-access-memory-ram-affects-performance?lang=en)<br>
Your computer's system memory is made up of physical memory, called Random Access Memory (RAM), and virtual memory. System memory is not permanent storage, like a hard disk drive that saves its contents when you turn off your system.<br>
6. [Techniques to handle Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)<br>
Thrashing is a condition or a situation when the system is spending a major portion of its time in servicing the page faults, but the actual processing done is very negligible.<br>
7. [Memory Hierarchy Design and its Characteristics](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-hierarchy-design-and-its-characteristics/)<br>
In the Computer System Design, Memory Hierarchy is an enhancement to organize the memory such that it can minimize the access time. <br>
8. [Memory allocation algorithm for cloud services](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-017-2069-8)<br>
Memory allocation has a major influence on multiuser systems, cloud-based services, virtual machines, and other computer systems.<br>
9. [What is non-uniform memory access in industrial controls?](https://www.motioncontroltips.com/what-is-non-uniform-memory-access-in-industrial-controls/)<br>
Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) is a kind of memory architecture that allows a processor faster access to contents of memory than other traditional techniques.<br>
10. [Allocating kernel memory (buddy system and slab system)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocating-kernel-memory-buddy-system-slab-system/)<br>
Buddy allocation system is an algorithm in which a larger memory block is divided into small parts to satisfy the request. This algorithm is used to give best fit. The two smaller parts of block are of equal size and called as buddies.<br>
