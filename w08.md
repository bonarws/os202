TOP 10 List on Week 08!

1. [How does OS scheduler schedule threads that belong to two different processes (tasks)?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10846181/how-does-os-scheduler-schedule-threads-that-belong-to-two-different-processes-t)<br>
As far as all books say, switching between tasks/processes is more expensive than switching between threads of the same process/task. If so, then scheduler of threads-aware OS should schedule threads in such way that the threads of the same process/task should be executed next to each other (grouped) and not interleaved with threads from other processes/tasks.<br>
2. [Windows Task Scheduler Software](https://www.advsyscon.com/en-us/activebatch/job-scheduling/task-scheduler)<br>
Microsoft Windows Task Scheduler is used to create basic tasks and to manage task scheduling.<br>
3. [About: Application domain](http://dbpedia.org/page/Application_domain)<br>
An application domain is a mechanism (similar to a process in an operating system) used within the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) to isolate executed software applications from one another so that they do not affect each other.<br>
4. [The application must maintain a separate execution domain for each executing process.](https://www.stigviewer.com/stig/application_security_and_development/2017-12-18/finding/V-70233)<br>
Applications can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each process has a distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed in a manner controlled through the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process.<br>
5. [Process Scheduling and Process Schedular](https://tutorialwing.com/process-scheduling-and-process-schedular/)<br>
In this topic, we will discuss about what is process scheduler, why we use it in operating system and different types of scheduler.<br>
6. [A Comparison of 5 Uniprocessor OS Scheduling Policies](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/04/27/uniprocessor-scheduling-policy-comparison/)<br>
In my recent post on Uniprocessor OS Scheduling Policies, I covered the algorithms for five short-term operating system scheduling policies:<br>
7. [Node.js multithreading: What are Worker threads, and why do they matter?](https://blog.logrocket.com/node-js-multithreading-what-are-worker-threads-and-why-do-they-matter-48ab102f8b10/)<br>
Since the release of Node.js v10.5.0, thereâ€™s a new worker_threads module available, and it has been stable since Node.js v12 LTS. What exactly is this Worker thread module, and why do we need it?<br>
8. [Advantages and disadvantages with Static- and Dynamic Scheduling](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40069587/advantages-and-disadvantages-with-static-and-dynamic-scheduling)<br>
Generally we would never have a computer program which would completely depend on only one of Static or Dynamic Scheduling.<br>
9. [Preemptive Scheduling with Release Times, Deadlines, and Due Times](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/322326.322337)<br>
We deal with the problem of finding preemptive schedules for jobs with restricted availability on parallel processors.<br>
10. [Selecting the right RTOS scheduling algorithms using system modelling](https://www.embedded.com/selecting-the-right-rtos-scheduling-algorithms-using-system-modelling/)<br>
Most high-performance embedded systems do not need an expensive and full-functionality real-time operating system (RTOS).<br>
