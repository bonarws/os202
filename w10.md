TOP 10 List on Week 10!

1. [General-purpose I/O (GPIO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/general-purpose-i-o--gpio-)<br>
System on a Chip (SoC) integrated circuits make extensive use of general-purpose I/O (GPIO) pins.<br>
2. [I/O problems present challenges, opportunities](https://www.eetimes.com/i-o-problems-present-challenges-opportunities/#)<br>
As computer design enters a new era of Net-centric connectedness in which the applications to be processed are no longer inside the system, but “out there” on the network, two companies are capitalizing on the importance of efficient input/output to create unique solutions.<br>
3. [IO Software](https://zitoc.com/io-software/)<br>
IO software is frequently organized in the following layers<br>
4. [Input/Output (I/O) Modules](https://www.rockwellautomation.com/tr-tr/products/hardware/allen-bradley/i-o.html)<br>
Choose from chassis-based I/O that is integrated with your Allen‑Bradley controller, or I/O that is distributed around your application or mounted on a machine. <br>
5. [Real Time vs Batch Processing vs Stream Processing](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/batch-processing-stream-processing-real-time/)<br>
With the constant rate of current innovations, developers can expect to analyze terabytes and even petabytes of data in any given period of time. <br>
6. [Linux I/O disk elevator](https://www.gnutoolbox.com/linux-io-elevator/)<br>
From 2.6 kernel Linux employs a new I/O elevator model. While the Linux kernel 2.4 used a single, general-purpose I/O elevator, kernel 2.6 offers the choice of four elevators.<br>
7. [Profit data caching and hybrid disk‐aware Completely Fair Queuing scheduling algorithms for hybrid disks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/spe.2279)<br>
Recently, a hybrid disk drive that integrates a small amount of flash memory within a mechanical drive has received significant attention.<br>
8. [Efficient Memory-Mapped I/O on Fast Storage Device](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303426907_Efficient_Memory-Mapped_IO_on_Fast_Storage_Device)<br>
In modern operating systems, memory-mapped I/O (mmio) is an important access method that maps a file or file-like resource to a region of memory.<br>
9. [Difference between Maskable and NonMaskable Interrupts](http://embeddedguruji.blogspot.com/2013/04/difference-between-maskable-and.html)<br>
Maskable Interrupt:, Non-Maskable Interrupt:<br>
10. [DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS ATTACKS – A WALK DOWN MEMORY LANE](https://eclypsium.com/2020/01/30/direct-memory-access-attacks/)<br>
Eclypsium’s latest research shows that enterprise laptops, servers, and cloud environments continue to be vulnerable to powerful Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks, even in the presence of protections such as UEFI Secure Boot, Intel Boot Guard, HP Sure Start, and Microsoft Virtualization-Based Security.<br>
