TOP 10 List on Week 03!

1. [What is File System Interface?](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/operating-system-concepts/9780471694663/ch10.html#:~:text=The%20file%20system%20consists%20of,the%20files%20in%20the%20system.)<br>
The file system consists of two distinct parts: a collection of files, each storing related data, and a directory structure, which organizes and provides information about all the files in the system.<br>
2. [File System Organization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-organization-in-dbms-set-1/#:~:text=File%20Organization%20refers%20to%20the,order%20is%20called%20file%20Organization.)<br>
File Organization refers to the logical relationships among various records that constitute the file, particularly with respect to the means of identification and access to any specific record. In simple terms, Storing the files in certain order is called file Organization.<br>
3. [Linux file structure](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/linux-directory-structure-and-file-system-hierarchy/)<br>
Here are the most common top level directories that you need to be aware of and may interact with as a user of a Linux system.<br>
4. [Operating System I/O Hardware](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_security.htm#:~:text=System%20threats%20refers%20to%20misuse,resources%2F%20user%20files%20are%20misused.)<br>
One of the important jobs of an Operating System is to manage various I/O devices including mouse, keyboards, touch pad, disk drives, display adapters, USB devices, Bit-mapped screen, LED, Analog-to-digital converter, On/off switch, network connections, audio I/O, printers etc. <br>
5. [File System Implementation on OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-system-implementation-in-operating-system/#:~:text=A%20file%20is%20a%20collection,stored%2C%20located%2C%20and%20retrieved.)<br>
A file is a collection of related information. The file system resides on secondary storage and provides efficient and convenient access to the disk by allowing data to be stored, located, and retrieved.<br>
6. [File system overview](https://www.netbsd.org/docs/internals/en/chap-file-system.html#fs_overview)<br>
 On-disk file systems, Network file systems, Synthetic file systems,  Layered file systems, Helper file systems<br>
7. [What is FUSE?](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html)<br>
One of the most important features of FUSE is allowing secure, non-privileged mounts. This opens up new possibilities for the use of filesystems. A good example is sshfs: a secure network filesystem using the sftp protocol.<br>
8. [File sharing](https://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/file-sharing#:~:text=File%20sharing%20is%20the%20public,various%20levels%20of%20access%20privilege.&text=Users%20may%20all%20have%20the,in%20a%20common%20file%20system.)<br>
File sharing is the public or private sharing of computer data or space in a network with various levels of access privilege.<br>
9. [Why we need virtual file system?](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/virtual-filesystems-linux)<br>
Accordingly, the kernel's default filesystem implementation is called a virtual filesystem (VFS).<br>
10. [File allocation method](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-allocation-methods/)<br>
The allocation methods define how the files are stored in the disk blocks. There are three main disk space or file allocation methods.<br>
