Week 02 TOP 10 LIST! 

1. Code Injection is COMMON!<br>
Attacks of this type can lead to stolen credentials, destroyed data, or even loss of control over the server. They are also surprisingly common, as the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Foundation ranks code injection first in its Top 10 Application Security Risks.
2. Watch out your e-mail SPAM<br>
Most businesses are aware on some level of the security threat posed by malware, yet many people are unaware that email spam is still the main vector of malware attack.
3. [What is Access Control List?](https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/access-control-list-acl/)<br>
An access control list (ACL) contains rules that grant or deny access to certain digital environments.
4. [System Threats](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_security.htm#:~:text=System%20threats%20refers%20to%20misuse,resources%2F%20user%20files%20are%20misused.)<br>
System threats refers to misuse of system services and network connections to put user in trouble. System threats can be used to launch program threats on a complete network called as program attack. System threats creates such an environment that operating system resources/ user files are misused. 
5. [Encryption](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/encryption)<br>
In computing, unencrypted data is also known as plaintext, and encrypted data is called ciphertext. The formulas used to encode and decode messages are called encryption algorithms, or ciphers.
6. [Security in Operating Systems](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_security.htm)<br>
So a computer system must be protected against unauthorized access, malicious access to system memory, viruses, worms etc
7. [What type of information you should protect?](https://www.reputationdefender.com/blog/privacy/top-ten-reasons-keep-your-personal-information-private#:~:text=Personal%20ID%20numbers%3A%20Your%20social,street%20address%20and%20email%20address)<br>
